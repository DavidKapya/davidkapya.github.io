This Privacy Policy explains how LSKVIBES LTD ("Zedmarket", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, stores, shares, and protects your information when you use the Zedmarket mobile application, website, and related services (collectively, the “Platform”). 
By creating an account or using the Platform, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
1. Information We Collect
We collect information that is necessary to operate a secure, efficient, and feature-rich digital marketplace.
1.1 Information You Provide Directly
•	Account Information: When you register, we collect your mobile phone number, name or username, and password. You may also voluntarily add other profile information, such as a profile picture, bio, location, and business hours.
•	User-Generated Content: We collect the content you create on the Platform, including product listings, images, descriptions, prices, ratings, and reviews. This also includes any edits you make to your listings or profile.
•	Communications: We collect information you provide when you communicate with other users through the Platform's messaging features or when you contact us for customer support.
1.2 Information from Your Use of the Service
•	Usage Data: We collect information about your interactions with the Platform, such as products you view, searches you perform, pages you visit, and features you use.
•	Device and Technical Data: We automatically collect data about the device you use to access our Platform, including your device type, operating system, app version, IP address, and unique device identifiers. We also collect crash reports and performance diagnostics to help us identify and fix issues.
•	Location Data: With your explicit permission, we may collect your precise location data to enable features like displaying nearby listings. You can disable this at any time in your device settings.
1.3 Transaction and Payment Information
•	Transaction Details: We collect details about transactions you conduct on the Platform, including the date, amount, and status of the transaction, as well as a reference ID.
•	In-App Purchase Information: When you make purchases through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store (e.g., for Premium Subscriptions, Product Sponsorships, or Contact Reveals), we receive information from them to confirm your purchase, such as a transaction receipt and your subscription status and expiry date. We do not receive your payment card details.
•	Third-Party Payments (Pawapay): For transactions processed by Pawapay, we receive a confirmation of the payment status from Pawapay. We do not collect or store your mobile money credentials or full payment card details.
2. How We Use Your Information
We use the information we collect for the following purposes:
•	To Provide and Manage the Service: To create and manage your account, authenticate you, display product listings, and enable the core functionality of the marketplace.
•	To Enable Transactions and Communication: To facilitate communication between buyers and sellers and to process transactions, subscriptions, and other in-app purchases.
•	To Personalise and Improve the Platform: To understand how users interact with the Platform, improve our features, fix bugs, and develop new services.
•	For Safety and Security: To prevent fraud, protect the security of our Platform, enforce our Terms of Service, and protect our users.
•	To Provide Customer Support: To respond to your questions, feedback, or support requests.
•	To Communicate With You: To send you important service-related notifications, updates to our terms or policies, and, with your consent, promotional messages.
3. Sharing and Disclosure of Information
We do not sell your personal data to third parties. We only share your information in the following limited circumstances:
•	With Other Users: Your public profile information (name, profile picture, bio), product listings, and reviews are visible to other users on the Platform. Your direct contact information is only shared with another user if you are a seller and the other user has paid the "Contact Reveal" fee.
•	With Service Providers: We share necessary information with trusted third-party partners who perform services on our behalf. These include:
o	Payment Processors: Such as Pawapay, the Apple App Store, and the Google Play Store, to process transactions.
o	In-App Purchase Management: Such as RevenueCat to manage subscriptions and other in-app purchases.
o	Infrastructure and Hosting: Such as Supabase for database, authentication, and cloud storage.
o	Analytics and Crash Reporting: To help us understand usage and improve the app. These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.
•	For Legal Reasons: We may disclose your information if we believe it is required by law, a court order, or a legitimate request from a governmental authority. We may also share it to protect the rights, property, or safety of Zedmarket, our users, or the public.
•	Business Transfers: In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you of any such change in ownership or control of your personal data.
4. Data Retention and Deletion
We retain your personal data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with the Service. We may also retain certain information for a longer period to comply with our legal and financial obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.
When you delete your account, your profile and active listings will be removed from public view. Some information, such as transaction records and communications with our support team, will be retained for legal and security purposes. Public content you created, such as reviews, may be anonymised and retained.
5. Security Measures
We implement robust technical and organisational security measures to protect your information, including secure authentication, data encryption in transit, and access controls. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. You are also responsible for keeping your account password confidential and your device secure.
6. Your Rights and Choices
Depending on your jurisdiction, you have certain rights regarding your personal data. These may include the right to:
•	Access and Rectify: You can access and update most of your profile information directly through your account settings in the app.
•	Data Portability: Request a copy of your personal data in an electronic format.
•	Erasure (Deletion): Request the deletion of your account and personal data, subject to our legal retention obligations.
•	Withdraw Consent: Withdraw your consent for processing data where consent is the legal basis (e.g., location services).
•	Restrict or Object to Processing: Object to our processing of your personal data for certain purposes, such as direct marketing.
To exercise these rights, please contact us using the details provided below.
